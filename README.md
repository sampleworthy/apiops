# APIM Python Script

This Python script is used to automate the process of importing API specifications into Azure API Management (APIM) and adding them to a product.

## How it works

1. The script first retrieves environment variables that contain necessary information such as the client ID, client secret, resource group name, APIM service name, tenant ID, and subscription ID.

2. It then sets the directory containing the API specifications (`apis` by default).

3. The script uses the `glob` module to recursively find all `.yaml` and `.json` files in the `apis` directory and its subdirectories.

4. If no API files are found, the script exits.

5. For each API file found, the script constructs a command to import the API into APIM. This command includes the resource group, service name, API path, API type, API ID, display name, protocols, specification format, and specification path.

6. The script runs the command using the `subprocess` module.

7. After the API is imported, the script constructs another command to add the API to a product in APIM. The product ID is specified in the script.

8. The script runs the command to add the API to the product.

## Usage

To use this script, you need to set the environment variables with your Azure credentials and information. You also need to replace `'test-product'` with your actual product ID in APIM.

Place your `.yaml` and `.json` API specification files in the `apis` directory (or a subdirectory within `apis`). Then, simply run the script:

```bash
python apim.py
```

The script will import all API specifications into APIM and add them to the specified product.

In the selected code from the `apim.py` script, the product ID is specified with the `product_id` variable:

```python
product_id = 'test-product'  # Replace with your actual product ID
```

To specify your own product ID, replace `'test-product'` with the ID of the product in your Azure API Management instance. For example, if your product ID is `'my-product'`, you would change the line to:

```python
product_id = 'my-product'
```

This `product_id` is then used in the command that adds the API to the product:

```python
command = [
    'az', 'apim', 'product', 'api', 'add',
    '--resource-group', resourceGroupName,
    '--service-name', apimServiceName,
    '--product-id', product_id,
    '--api-id', api_name,
]
```

In this command, `'az', 'apim', 'product', 'api', 'add'` is the Azure CLI command to add an API to a product, and `--product-id`, `product_id` specifies the product to which the API should be added.
